    /**1st impression: 
     * I am supposed to  check if mountainH is the biggest compared to the other mountains
     * it's unclear to me what input we receive is it a array therefore mountainH[1] ?
     * or is it just a number for the height of the mountain below us ? 
     * I'm confused there is something i am supposed to know here.
     * ->Ask AI Copilot -> answer will be a number. input will be height of each mountain line by line.
     *  my goal is therefore to scan each line to determine the biggest number and provide that number in the console.log

/**2nd Still not getting any results the program won't accept my output nor my console.error tests. => Something is wrong, but what?
>tried erasing everything and only entering console.log(0); that destroys the first mountain and crashes on the second. Progress, something happened! Now to find the problem in my code
**/
/**3rd I have moved the console.log and error into the conditional statement now it is sending an answer of console.log(0) and that destroys the 1st mountain. 
then i get 3 ship passes each with time for i to loop 8 times. but my answer stays stuck to 0.
Why does the value not update?
> Perhaps it is being assigned outside of the conditional

4th okay i was chasing the wrong answer mountainH gives the height of the mountain NOT the target, the target is the value of i when that mountainH is visible. so console.log(i)

5th ok shot down first mountain, but having trouble updating tallestMountain. it stays stuck on case1: i=0 mountainH=9 even after its destroyed.

6th change location of declaring the target inside the if loop or after, changed the reset location of tallestMountain
7th all cases past.
8th cleaning it up and adding comments
